# Gravity Balling
This is the Swift Xcode Playground version of my IOS application Gravity Balling. Gravity Balling is a 3D game created in Swift using frameworks SceneKit(3D graphics) and SpriteKit(2D graphics).
## Running
To run the application download the [GravityBalling.playground](https://github.com/mkang30/GravityBalling/blob/master/GravityBalling.playground.zip) file and open it in the Xcode IDE.
## Description
The gameplay is very simple. First, you choose a planet - mind that the graivty changes depending on a planet (so the identical swipe in Jupiter will launch the ball with lower speed/power than that in Earth). If you want to learn more about the planets click on the info button under the planets. Next, you will see a goalpost and target(s), moving inside it, and a ball that you can fire with a finger(or mouse in the playground version) swipe. Your task is to shoot as many targets as you can, but remember that you have only 10 trials, and targets move faster with each successful strike. Try to get the maximum score of 10!
